* SocialVisTUM - contains the exercise sheet with the SocialVisTUM approach. This version is an early and incomplete draft and not fully functioning. This sheet is only included to showcase how a similar approach with SocialVisTUM could look like.
* Other files contain the final version with BERTopic from this cycle.

Note: The students will only receive the climate_tweets.csv file. climate_tweets_complete.csv contains further attributes, which are not needed for this exercise, but might be useful in the future.
